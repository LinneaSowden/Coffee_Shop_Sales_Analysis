In this Excel file I completed a guided project on Maven Analytics.
The project involved coffee shop sales data for 3 locations in New York City.
I used functions to find the revenue, month, weekday, and hour of each transaction.
I then created PivotTables and Pivot Charts to gain insights into the data to make recommendations to help the coffee shops increase profits. 
I formatted the charts for better readability.
